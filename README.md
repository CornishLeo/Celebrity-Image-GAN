# Celebrity-Image-GAN
This project is a practice learning how to create GAN networks to generate images of fictional celebrities.

The project is completed however further adjustments to the model could be made to improve the quality of the outputted images.

The project uses a free online data set of celebrity images and uses python with tensorflow to create the model.

The model has already been trained and images from the steps were saved in a log (celeb_logs) and can be accessed by using the command
>> tensorboard --logdir logs_celeb
